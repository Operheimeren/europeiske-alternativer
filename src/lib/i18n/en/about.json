  "content": "Big tech companies are gaining more and more power – and it's easy to feel powerless in the face of it. But the truth is that we as consumers have more influence than we think, through the choices we make every day. The services we use – and the ones we choose to support – truly matter.<br><br>We found it difficult to locate clear and up-to-date overviews of European alternatives that take privacy and data protection seriously. That's why we created this website – an independent and non-commercial platform – to help more people discover European services where you, the user, stay in control of your data while supporting European innovation and values.<br><br>As of today, we have no partnerships and receive no financial support from any of the services mentioned or others. This means the information you find here is free from third-party influence.<br><br>We hope this site can help you make safer and more informed choices in your everyday digital life.",
